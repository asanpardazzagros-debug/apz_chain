GitHub Docs
Welcome to GitHub Docs! GitHubâ€™s documentation is open source, meaning anyone from inside or outside the company can contribute. For full contributing guidelines, visit our contributing guide

Quick links by contributor type
Hubbers (GitHub employees): See CONTRIBUTING.md in the docs-content repository for GitHub-specific processes.

Open source contributors: See CONTRIBUTING.md in the docs repository for a quick-start summary.

How we sync changes across Docs repositories
There are two GitHub Docs repositories:

github/docs (public): Open to external contributions

github/docs-internal (private): For GitHub employee contributions.

The two repositories sync frequently. Content changes in one are reflected in the other. Hubbers might prefer to post in docs when working with a customer, but docs has limitations on the types of contributions it accepts to safeguard the site and our workflows. Internal contributions should usually go to docs-internal.

Important: The docs repository accepts contributions to content files (.md files in /content and select /data sections like reusables only). Infrastructure files, workflows, and site-building code are not open for external modification.
